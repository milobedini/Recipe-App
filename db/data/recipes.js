      "Make the crust. Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. In a medium bowl, stir together the graham cracker crumbs, granulated sugar, brown sugar, salt, and butter to combine. Pat the mixture into a 10-inch springform pan, pressing the crumbs firmly in an even layer on the bottom and making sure they come at least halfway up the side of the pan. Bake for 7 to 10 minutes, until the crust is fragrant, dry, and toasty. Let cool, then wrap the entire outside of the pan tightly in two layers of foil, all the way to the top.",
      "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or in a large bowl using a handheld mixer, cream the plain cream cheese and sugar on medium-high speed for about 4 minutes, until incredibly smooth and light. Stop the mixer and scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the Creole Cream Cheese and vanilla paste and beat on medium-high speed for about 2 minutes, scraping down the bowl once more. Decrease the speed to medium and beat in the eggs, one at a time, incorporating each one before adding the next. Mix just until the batter is smooth and uniform. Continuing to mix past that point, even though the batter won\u2019t look different, only incorporates extra air, which will cause the cheesecake to bubble excessively and the surface to crack as that air tries to escape during the baking process.",
      "Decrease the oven temperature to 350\u00b0F. Pour the batter into the prepared crust and tap the pan gently on the counter a few times to remove any large air bubbles. Place the springform pan in a large baking or roasting pan (just big enough for the springform pan to fit in) and set the pan on the middle rack in the oven. Fill the pan with enough hot water to reach the rim of the springform pan. Bake for about 1 hour, or until the sides of the custard are set and the middle is still just slightly wobbly. Generally, if the entirety of the custard is fully set, your cheesecake is overbaked. Don\u2019t panic\u2014it\u2019ll still be delicious, and you\u2019ll do better next time!",

However, if you\u2019re worried that your cheesecake might be slightly overbaked, you\u2019ll want to pull it out rather quickly, and let it cool at room temperature. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours before slicing. The cake can be refrigerated, covered, for up to 4 days.",
      "In a large heavy-bottomed saut\u00e9 pan, heat the butter until melted. Stir in the granulated sugar, brown sugar, and honey and let cook until bubbling. Add the apples and toss to coat. Stir in the lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, cinnamon, cardamom, and ginger; stir to combine. Cook for about 4 minutes, or until the apples just start to soften. Remove from the heat, stir in the vanilla, and transfer to a bowl to cool completely before use. The filling can be made up to 3 days ahead of time and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator.",

Peel off any tough skins, such as on beets, winter squash, and onions, and trim the tops. Leave the vegetables whole or cut them into the desired finished shape. Place the vegetables in a nonreactive container and pour water to completely submerge them; as you do so, keep track of how much water you\u2019re adding since the amount of water will dictate the amount of salt (generally 3.5 percent salt by weight of the water for most vegetables, although cucumbers can handle 4 to 5 percent and the increased salt assists with keeping their texture crispy). With a long wooden spoon, stir kosher salt into the brine (or add the salt, cap the jar, and give it a hearty shake) until the salt is dissolved. Place a weight on top of the vegetables to keep them submerged in the brine. Seal the container, using a lid with an airlock if you have one. If you don\u2019t have an airlock, you\u2019ll just need to open the container every few days or so to release carbon dioxide buildup and check for mold. Place the container in a clean, low-light area with an ambient temperature of 60\u00b0F to 68\u00b0F until the pickles taste sour, about 3 weeks. Refrigerate indefinitely.",

Taste the dashi every 20 minutes to monitor the changes in flavor and texture. You will notice the texture becoming softer. I describe it as having a slippery, slightly viscous texture compared to tap water. The sea flavor will become stronger, and the dashi will become darker, like pale Earl Grey tea. The sweetness will take a while to appear, but when it does, the dashi is almost ready. When you can taste the sweetness and deep sea flavors, and the dashi has a very soft texture, it is done. Be vigilant, because dashi will become bitter if cooked too long.",
      "Strain the dashi into a covered container and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. After 24 hours, the dashi will begin to lose some of its flavor and it will turn slightly flat.",

Gallotannin, one of the main tannins present in sumac, is bitter to taste and dissolves in water easily. Avoid steeping the sumac for too long or its tannins will make the syrup bitter. Saffron is ground to a fine powder using a little sugar as an abrasive. Grinding saffron increases the amount of color and flavor extracted than would be achieved if the strands were used directly. Club soda if used, adds a second note of acidity from the carbonic acid as well as the crackling sound of bubbles that create a sensation via chemesthesis.",

Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the bottom of the pancake has set. Once it has set, gently slide your spatula under the edges of the pancake and lift them, tilting the pan, so some of the hot oil runs underneath the pancake. Then cook for 2 to 3 minutes more, until the bottom is a deep golden brown and crisp. You can check the color by gently lifting an edge of the pancake with your spatula. Flip the pancake and cook on the other side for 3 to 4 minutes, until it is golden brown on the second side and cooked through. Transfer to the prepared sheet pan to drain. Wipe out the pan, set it back over high heat, add another tablespoon or so of oil, and repeat until all of the pancakes are cooked. The finished pancakes can be kept in a low (200\u00b0F) oven on a clean sheet pan while you cook the remaining batches, but it\u2019s best to eat them right away.",
